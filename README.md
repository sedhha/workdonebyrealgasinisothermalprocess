# workdonebyrealgasinisothermalprocess
A Matlab program to compute work done by a real gas in Isothermal process based on any three process parameters and force and volume correction factors.
The program inputs in total 5 data:
Force Correction factor for real gases
Volume Correction factor for real gases
P1/P2/V1/V2 (Any 3 of the 4)
It computes the force assuming the process to be iso-thermal and Quasi-static.
